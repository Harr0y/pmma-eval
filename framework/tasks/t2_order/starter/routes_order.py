T2 Order System — Order Routes

Implement order CRUD, state machine, and payment with idempotency.
Register as a Flask Blueprint named 'order_bp'.

Order state machine:
  pending → paid → shipped → delivered
  pending/paid → cancelled

Requirements:
- POST /orders -> Create order
  Request: {"user_id": str, "items": [{"product_id": int, "quantity": int}, ...]}
  Response: {"status": "ok", "data": {"id": int, "user_id": str, "status": "pending",
            "total_amount": float, "created_at": str}}
  - Validates all products exist and stock is available
  - Creates OrderItem records for each product
  - total_amount = sum of (product.price * quantity) for all items
  Errors: 400 if invalid data, product not found, or insufficient stock

- GET /orders/<id> -> Get order with items
  Response: {"status": "ok", "data": {"id": int, "user_id": str, "status": str,
            "total_amount": float, "created_at": str,
            "items": [{"id": int, "product_id": int, "quantity": int, "unit_price": float}, ...]}}
  Errors: 404 if not found

- GET /orders -> List orders, filter by user_id and/or status
  Query params: user_id, status
  Response: {"status": "ok", "data": [...]}

- POST /orders/<id>/pay -> Pay for order (pending → paid)
  Header: Idempotency-Key (required)
  - Deducts stock from products
  - Records PaymentRequest for idempotency
  - Duplicate Idempotency-Key returns same result without re-processing
  Errors: 404 if order not found, 400 if no key, 409 if invalid state transition

- POST /orders/<id>/ship -> Ship order (paid → shipped)
  Errors: 404 if not found, 409 if invalid state

- POST /orders/<id>/deliver -> Deliver order (shipped → delivered)
  Errors: 404 if not found, 409 if invalid state

- POST /orders/<id>/cancel -> Cancel order (pending/paid → cancelled)
  - Restores product stock if order was paid
  Errors: 404 if not found, 409 if invalid state

IMPORTANT: This module works with models.py (Order, OrderItem, PaymentRequest, Product)
and routes_product.py. Stock deduction happens at payment time, not order creation.
